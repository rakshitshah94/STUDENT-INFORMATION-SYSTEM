Hey There !!!
This is Rakshit shah , Are you Newbie for Php | mysql ??

Don't worry , I will Guide you...
 
You have to  follow this steps:

≡ You have to first install XAMPP | WAMPP  (google it | download it | install it) to run php on local host 
I would prefer XAMPP for windows n ubuntu

≡ then check it on browser (chrome , firefox , any )
by typing on address bar >> localhost 
that will show you its working or showing some page  

≡ after that type in address bar >> localhost/phpmyadmin

≡ create new DATABASE  >>  name : studentinfo

≡ click on studentinfo (left side column)

≡ now at middle-top side you can see Import/Export button >>click on import button 

≡ choose file which you downloaded in this folder having name :  studentinfo (1).sql

≡ then click on GO button (@bottom side) you have almost done (only database work) , you can see many tables are created inside studentinfo database

≡ Now
[windows user] 
 if you are using XAMPP:
  		in c drive c:\\ xampp>>htdocs(root file)>>student(create folder) >> copy whole folder which you downloaded
 if you are using XAMPP:
  		in c drive c:\\ wampp>>www(root file)>>student(create folder) >> copy whole folder which you downloaded  

≡ Now come to browser >> @addressbar type >> http://localhost/student/StudentInformationProject/

≡ this will directly open INDEX.PHP of  StudentInformationProject folder & you can see semi-responsive website which I have created.

≡ Now you have to check values in tables and insert to given text boxes

≡ [HOME PAGE] : detail about this website
≡ [STUDENT]:
	search by number : insert>>  5 then press submit 
		you will see result
	press back @bottom side 
	
	if you want to search by name :insert  rakshit 
		and choose "RAX"
		then press submit

		@bottom side you can see student detail
		click on folder showing result>> you see that result xD	

≡ [ADMIN] 

		<<<admin>>>
		username: 111
		pswd : rax

		<<<lecturer>>> 
		username : 3
		pswd : rax

		≡ after login you can check all the menus edit , delete , modify whatever you want ...

After checking >>
click on LOGOUT @right side 
you will be redirected to login page after  2 seconds ...

««If you see error then it may be fault of your apache server | browser | other.... :P»»
